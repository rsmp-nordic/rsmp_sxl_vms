# Use-cases
A wide variety of  variable messages signs are in use, from urban parking signs and bicycle counters ot highway control systsem and speed limit signs.

Here we list real-world use-cases that we we want our VMS SXL to support. This list is by no means exhaustive, rather it's examples of use-cases that we know we want to support. The display types can be combined to support an wide range of use-cases.

For each use-case we list the displays components by type.
